### Message and Response

The base component of a conversation is utterance.
Kovot provides `Message` and `Response` classes to represent utterances.

`Message` class represents user utterance.
It is generated by taking `text` as an argument

```py
from kovot import Message
msg = Message(text="This is utterance.")
```

`Message` class optionaly takes `Speaker` object which represents a speaker of the utterance.

```py
from kovot import Speaker
msg = Message(text="This is utterance",
              speaker=Speaker(name="Speaker name"))
```

`Response` class represents system response to user utterance.
`Response` class takes two arguments;

- `text` as a sentence of the response
- `score` as a appropriateness

```py
from kovot import Response
res = Response(text="This is a response", score=1.0)
```

Like `Message`, `Resposne` class takes following arguments as well as `speaker`. 

- `message` correspoinding to the response
- `source` as a `Mod` name generating the response

```py
res = Response(text="This is a response",
               score=1.0,
               message=msg,
               source="source name")
```
